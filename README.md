## Releases

Binary versions are available on the [Releases](https://github.com/jcfieldsdev/power-rename/releases) page.

Some very old versions of Windows may require installing the [Visual Basic 6 runtime](https://github.com/jcfieldsdev/power-rename/raw/master/vbrun60-setup.exe), but newer versions have these files preinstalled.

## Guide

Load files into it by selecting "Open" from the *File* menu or by dragging and dropping files onto the program icon. Files must be located in the same folder.

You can also add it to the `SendTo` folder so you can select files in the file manager and rename them through the context menu:
